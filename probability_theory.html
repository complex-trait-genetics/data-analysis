<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Probability Theory</h1>
<p>In what follows here, our focus is on some of the probability distribution and relevant functions required to solve simple problems. We will start by re-freshing some core concepts of probability theory. You will learn how to draw random numbers, how to compute densities, probabilities, quantiles and the like. We will see how a few distributions are extremely useful as they underlie the majority of statistical testing conducted in biology.</p>
<p>Most of the statistical functionalities in <tt>R</tt>’s standard version are collected in the <tt>stats</tt> package. It provides simple functions which compute descriptive measures and facilitate computations involving a variety of probability distributions. It also contains more sophisticated routines that, e.g., enable the user to estimate a large number of models based on the same data or help to conduct extensive simulation studies. <tt>stats</tt> is part of the base distribution of <tt>R</tt>, meaning that it is installed by default so there is no need to run <code>install.packages(&quot;stats&quot;)</code> or <code>library(&quot;stats&quot;)</code>. Simply execute <code>library(help = &quot;stats&quot;)</code> in the console to view the documentation and a complete list of all functions gathered in <tt>stats</tt>. For most packages a documentation that can be viewed within <em>RStudio</em> is available. Documentations can be invoked using the <tt>?</tt> operator, e.g., upon execution of <code>?stats</code> the documentation of the <tt>stats</tt> package is shown in the help tab of the bottom-right pane.</p>
<div id="random-variables-and-probability-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Random Variables</h2>
<p>Let us briefly review some basic concepts of probability theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mutually exclusive results of a random process are called the <em>outcomes</em>. ‘Mutually exclusive’ means that only one of the possible outcomes can be observed.</li>
<li>We refer to the <em>probability</em> of an outcome as the proportion that the outcome occurs in the long run, that is, if the experiment is repeated very often.</li>
<li>The set of all possible outcomes of a random variable is called the <em>sample space</em>.</li>
<li>An <em>event</em> is a subset of the sample space and consists of one or more outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are unified in the concept of a <em>random variable</em> which is a numerical summary of random outcomes. Random variables can be <em>discrete</em> or <em>continuous</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrete random variables have discrete outcomes, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>A continuous random variable may take on a continuum of possible values.</li>
</ul>
<div id="probability-distributions-of-discrete-random-variables" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Discrete Random Variables</h3>
<p>A typical example for a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the result of a dice roll: in terms of a random experiment this is nothing but randomly selecting a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from a set of numbers which are mutually exclusive outcomes. Here, the sample space is <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span> and we can think of many different events, e.g., ‘the observed outcome lies between <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>’.</p>
<p>A basic function to draw random samples from a specified set of elements is the the function <tt>sample()</tt>, see <code>?sample</code>. We can use it to simulate the random outcome of a dice roll. Let’s roll the dice!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample(1:6, 1) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is the list of all possible values of the variable and their probabilities which sum to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. The cumulative probability distribution function gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a particular value.</p>
<p>For the dice roll, the probability distribution and the cumulative probability distribution are summarized in Table <a href="tab:pdist">1</a>.</p>

<p>We can easily plot both functions using <tt>R</tt>. Since the probability equals <span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span> for each outcome, we set up the vector <tt>probability</tt> by using the function <tt>rep()</tt> which replicates a given value a specified number of times.</p>
<div class="unfolded">
<pre class="r"><code># generate the vector of probabilities 
probability &lt;- rep(1/6, 6)

<h3>Bernoulli Trials</h3>
<p>The set of elements from which <tt>sample()</tt> draws outcomes does not have to consist of numbers only. We might as well simulate coin tossing with outcomes <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> (heads) and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (tails).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), 1) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;H&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The result of a single coin toss is a <em>Bernoulli</em> distributed random variable, i.e., a variable with two possible distinct outcomes.</p>
<p>Imagine you are about to toss a coin <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> times in a row and wonder how likely it is to end up with a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> times heads. This is a typical example of what we call a <em>Bernoulli experiment</em> as it consists of <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> Bernoulli trials that are independent of each other and we are interested in the likelihood of observing <span class="math inline">\(k=5\)</span> successes <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> that occur with probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> (assuming a fair coin) in each trial. Note that the order of the outcomes does not matter here.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">well known result</a> that the number of successes <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in a Bernoulli experiment follows a binomial distribution. We denote this as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k \sim B(n,p).\]</span></p>
<p>The probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> successes in the experiment <span class="math inline">\(B(n,p)\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(k)=P(k)=\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k \end{pmatrix} \cdot p^k \cdot
(1-p)^{n-k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k \end{pmatrix}\)</span> the binomial coefficient.</p>
<p>In <tt>R</tt>, we can solve problems like the one stated above by means of the function <tt>dbinom()</tt> which calculates <span class="math inline">\(P(k\vert n, p)\)</span> the probability of the binomial distribution given the parameters <tt>x</tt> (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), <tt>size</tt> (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>), and <tt>prob</tt> (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>), see <code>?binom</code>. Let us compute <span class="math inline">\(P(k=5\vert n = 10, p = 0.5)\)</span> (we write this short as <span class="math inline">\(P(k=5)\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dbinom(x = 5,
       size = 10,
       prob = 0.5) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.2460938</code></pre>
<p>We conclude that <span class="math inline">\(P(k=5)\)</span>, the probability of observing Head <span class="math inline">\(k=5\)</span> times when tossing a fair coin <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> times is about <span class="math inline">\(24.6\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now assume we are interested in <span class="math inline">\(P(4 \leq k \leq 7)\)</span>, i.e., the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> successes for <span class="math inline">\(B(10, 0.5)\)</span>. This may be computed by providing a vector as the argument <tt>x</tt> in our call of <tt>dbinom()</tt> and summing up using <tt>sum()</tt>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute P(4 &lt;= k &lt;= 7) using &#39;dbinom()&#39;
sum(dbinom(x = 4:7, size = 10, prob = 0.5))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7734375</code></pre>
<p>An alternative approach is to use <tt>pbinom()</tt>, the distribution function of the binomial distribution to compute <span class="math display">\[P(4 \leq k \leq 7) = P(k \leq 7) - P(k\leq3 ).\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute P(4 &lt;= k &lt;= 7) using &#39;pbinom()&#39;
pbinom(size = 10, prob = 0.5, q = 7) - pbinom(size = 10, prob = 0.5, q = 3) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7734375</code></pre>
<p>The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is nothing but a list of all possible outcomes that can occur and their respective probabilities. In the coin tossing example we have <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> possible outcomes for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set up vector of possible outcomes
k &lt;- 0:10</code></pre>
<p>To visualize the probability distribution function of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> we may therefore do the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># assign the probabilities
probability &lt;- dbinom(x = k,
                      size = 10, 
                      prob = 0.5)
# plot the outcomes against their probabilities
plot(x = k, 
     y = probability,
     main = &quot;Probability Distribution Function&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="probability_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In a similar fashion we may plot the cumulative distribution function of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by executing the following code chunk:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute cumulative probabilities
prob &lt;- pbinom(q = k, 
               size = 10, 
               prob = 0.5)
# plot the cumulative probabilities
plot(x = k, 
     y = prob,
     main = &quot;Cumulative Distribution Function&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="probability_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="expected-value-mean-and-variance" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Expected Value, Mean and Variance</h3>
<p>The expected value of a random variable is, loosely, the long-run average value of its outcomes when the number of repeated trials is large. For a discrete random variable, the expected value is computed as a weighted average of its possible outcomes whereby the weights are the related probabilities. This is formalized in Key Concept 1.</p>
<div class = "keyconcept" <div class = "keyconcept" id="KC1"> 
<h3 class = "right"> Key Concept 1 </h3> 
<h3 class= "left"> Expected Value and the Mean </h3> 
<p> Suppose the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
takes on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> possible values, <span class="math inline">\(y_1, \dots, \y_k\)</span>, where $y_1$ denotes the first
value, $y_2$ denotes the second value, and so forth, and that the probability
that $Y$ takes on $y_1$ is $p_1$, the probability that $Y$ takes on $y_2$ is
$p_2$ and so forth. The expected value of $Y$, $E(Y)$ is defined as
$$ E(Y) = y_1 p_1 + y_2 p_2 + \cdots + y_k p_k = \sum_{i=1}^k y_i p_i $$
where the notation $\sum_{i=1}^k y_i p_i$ means "the sum of $y_i$ $p_i$ for $i$
running from $1$ to $k$". The expected value of $Y$ is also called the mean of $Y$
or the expectation of $Y$ and is denoted by $\mu_Y$.
</p> 
</div>
<p>In the dice example, the random variable, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> say, takes on <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> possible values <span class="math inline">\(d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, \dots, d_6 = 6\)</span>. Assuming a fair dice, each of the <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> outcomes occurs with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span>. It is therefore easy to calculate the exact value of <span class="math inline">\(E(D)\)</span> by hand:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E(D) = 1/6 \sum_{i=1}^6 d_i = 3.5 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E(D)\)</span> is simply the average of the natural numbers from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> since all weights <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span>. This can be easily calculated using the function <tt>mean()</tt> which computes the arithmetic mean of a numeric vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute mean of natural numbers from 1 to 6
mean(1:6)</code></pre>

Sequences of random numbers generated by R are pseudo-random numbers, i.e., they are not “truly” random but approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. Since this approximation is good enough for our purposes we refer to pseudo-random numbers as random numbers throughout this book. In general, sequences of random numbers are generated by functions called “pseudo-random number generators” (PRNGs). The PRNG in R works by performing some operation on a deterministic value. Generally, this value is the previous number generated by the PRNG. However, the first time the PRNG is used, there is no previous value. A “seed” is the first value of a sequence of numbers — it initializes the sequence. Each seed value will correspond to a different sequence of values. In R a seed can be set using <tt>set.seed()</tt>. This is convenient for us: If we provide the same seed twice, we get the same sequence of numbers twice. Thus, setting a seed before excecuting R code which invovles random numbers makes the outcome reproducible!

<p>Of course we could also consider a much bigger number of trials, <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> say. Doing so, it would be pointless to simply print the results to the console: by default <tt>R</tt> displays up to <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> entries of large vectors and omits the remainder (give it a try). Eyeballing the numbers does not reveal much. Instead, let us calculate the sample average of the outcomes using <tt>mean()</tt> and see if the result comes close to the expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(D)=3.5\)</span>.</p>

Variance and Standard Deviation

<p>
The variance of the discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_Y\)</span>, is <span class="math display">\[ \sigma^2_Y = \text{Var}(Y) = E\left[(Y-\mu_y)^2\right] = \sum_{i=1}^k (y_i - \mu_y)^2 p_i \]</span> The standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y\)</span>, the square root of the variance. The units of the standard deviation are the same as the units of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The variance as defined in Key Concept 2, being a population quantity, <em>is not</em> implemented as a function in R. Instead we have the function <tt>var()</tt> which computes the <em>sample variance</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ s^2_Y = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \overline{y})^2. \]</span></p>
<p>Remember that <span class="math inline">\(s^2_Y\)</span> is different from the so called <em>population variance</em> of a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Var}(Y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \mu_Y)^2. \]</span></p>
<p>since it measures how the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations in the sample are dispersed around the sample average <span class="math inline">\(\overline{y}\)</span>. Instead, <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(Y)\)</span> measures the dispersion of the whole population (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> members) around the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>. The difference becomes clear when we look at our dice rolling example. For <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Var}(D) = 1/6 \sum_{i=1}^6 (d_i - 3.5)^2 = 2.92  \]</span> which is obviously different from the result of <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span> as computed by <tt>var()</tt>.</p>

<h3>Probability Distributions of Continuous Random Variables</h3>
<p>Since a continuous random variable takes on a continuum of possible values, we cannot use the concept of a probability distribution as used for discrete random variables. Instead, the probability distribution of a continuous random variable is summarized by its <em>probability density function</em> (PDF).</p>
<p>The cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) for a continuous random variable is defined just as in the discrete case. Hence, the cumulative probability distribution of a continuous random variables states the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a particular value.</p>

Probabilities, Expected Value and Variance of a Continuous Random Variable
</h3>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline">\(f_Y(y)\)</span> denote the probability density function of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The probability that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> falls between <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[ P(a \leq Y \leq b) = \int_a^b f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y. \]</span> We further have that <span class="math inline">\(P(-\infty \leq Y \leq \infty) = 1\)</span> and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y = 1\)</span>. As for the discrete case, the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the probability weighted average of its values. Due to continuity, we use integrals instead of sums. The expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[ E(Y) =  \mu_Y = \int y f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y. \]</span> The variance is the expected value of <span class="math inline">\((Y - \mu_Y)^2\)</span>. We thus have <span class="math display">\[\text{Var}(Y) =  \sigma_Y^2 = \int (y - \mu_Y)^2 f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y.\]</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>Let us discuss an example:</p>
<p>Consider the continuous random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with probability density function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f_X(x) = \frac{3}{x^4}, x&gt;1. \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We can show analytically that the integral of <span class="math inline">\(f_X(x)\)</span> over the real line equals <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
 \int f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&amp;  \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =&amp; \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =&amp; \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}  -x^{-3} \rvert_{x=1}^t \\
  =&amp; -\left(\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{t^3} - 1\right) \\
  =&amp; 1
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The expectation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be computed as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
 E(X) = \int x \cdot f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&amp;  \int_{1}^{\infty} x \cdot \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =&amp; - \frac{3}{2} x^{-2} \rvert_{x=1}^{\infty} \\
  =&amp; -\frac{3}{2} \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t^2} - 1 \right) \\
  =&amp; \frac{3}{2}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the variance of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(E(X)\)</span> has been computed in the previous step, we seek <span class="math inline">\(E(X^2)\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
 E(X^2)= \int x^2 \cdot f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&amp;  \int_{1}^{\infty} x^2 \cdot \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =&amp; -3 x^{-1} \rvert_{x=1}^{\infty} \\
  =&amp; -3 \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} - 1 \right) \\
  =&amp; 3
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>So we have shown that the area under the curve equals one, that the expectation is <span class="math inline">\(E(X)=\frac{3}{2}\)</span> and we found the variance to be <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(X) = \frac{3}{4}\)</span>. However, this was tedious and, as we shall see, an analytic approach is not applicable for some probability density functions, e.g., if integrals have no closed form solutions.</p>
<p>Luckily, <tt>R</tt> also enables us to easily find the results derived above. The tool we use for this is the function <tt>integrate()</tt>. First, we have to define the functions we want to calculate integrals for as <tt>R</tt> functions, i.e., the PDF <span class="math inline">\(f_X(x)\)</span> as well as the expressions <span class="math inline">\(x\cdot f_X(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^2\cdot f_X(x)\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define functions
f &lt;- function(x) 3 / x^4
g &lt;- function(x) x * f(x)

<p>Next, we use <tt>integrate()</tt> and set lower and upper limits of integration to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> using arguments <tt>lower</tt> and <tt>upper</tt>.

<p>Although there is a wide variety of distributions, the ones most often encountered in biology are the normal, chi-squared, Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> distributions. Therefore we will discuss some core <tt>R</tt> functions that allow to do calculations involving densities, probabilities and quantiles of these distributions.</p>
<p>Every probability distribution that <tt>R</tt> handles has four basic functions whose names consist of a prefix followed by a root name. As an example, take the normal distribution. The root name of all four functions associated with the normal distribution is <tt>norm</tt>. The four prefixes are</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>d</tt> for “density” - probability function / probability density function</li>
<li><tt>p</tt> for “probability” - cumulative distribution function</li>
<li><tt>q</tt> for “quantile” - quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function)</li>
<li><tt>r</tt> for “random” - random number generator</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, for the normal distribution we have the <tt>R</tt> functions <tt>dnorm()</tt>, <tt>pnorm()</tt>, <tt>qnorm()</tt> and <tt>rnorm()</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-normal-distribution" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The Normal Distribution</h3>
<p>The most important probability distribution considered here is the normal distribution. This is not least due to the special role of the standard normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem which we will discuss shortly. Normal distributions are symmetric and bell-shaped. A normal distribution is characterized by its mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and its standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, concisely expressed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>. The normal distribution has the PDF</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp{-(x - \mu)^2/(2 \sigma^2)}.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>For the standard normal distribution we have <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span>. Standard normal variates are often denoted by <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. Usually, the standard normal PDF is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and the standard normal CDF is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math display">\[ \phi(c) = \Phi&#39;(c) \ \ , \ \ \Phi(c) = P(Z \leq c) \ \ , \ \ Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1).\]</span> In <tt>R</tt>, we can conveniently obtain densities of normal distributions using the function <tt>dnorm()</tt>. Let us draw a plot of the standard normal density function using <tt>curve()</tt> in conjunction with <tt>dnorm()</tt>.</p>
<div class="unfolded">
<pre class="r"><code># draw a plot of the N(0,1) PDF
curve(dnorm(x),
      xlim = c(-3.5, 3.5),
      ylab = &quot;Density&quot;, 
      main = &quot;Standard Normal Density Function&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="probability_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<p>We can obtain the density at different positions by passing a vector to <tt>dnorm()</tt>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute denstiy at x=-1.96, x=0 and x=1.96
dnorm(x = c(-1.96, 0, 1.96))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.05844094 0.39894228 0.05844094</code></pre>
<p>Similar to the PDF, we can plot the standard normal CDF using <tt>curve()</tt>. We could use <tt>dnorm()</tt> for this but it is much more convenient to rely on <tt>pnorm()</tt>.</p>
<div class="unfolded">
<pre class="r"><code># plot the standard normal CDF
curve(pnorm(x), 
      xlim = c(-3.5, 3.5), 
      ylab = &quot;Density&quot;, 
      main = &quot;Standard Normal Cumulative Distribution Function&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="probability_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<p>We can also use <tt>R</tt> to calculate the probability of events associated with a standard normal variate.</p>
<p>Let us say we are interested in <span class="math inline">\(P(Z \leq 1.337)\)</span>. For some continuous random variable <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\([-\infty,\infty]\)</span> with density <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> we would have to determine <span class="math inline">\(G(x)\)</span>, the anti-derivative of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> so that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(Z \leq 1.337 ) = G(1.337) = \int_{-\infty}^{1.337} g(x) \mathrm{d}x.  \]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(g(x)=\phi(x)\)</span>. There is no analytic solution to the integral above. Fortunately, <tt>R</tt> offers good approximations. The first approach makes use of the function <tt>integrate()</tt> which allows to solve one-dimensional integration problems using a numerical method. For this, we first define the function we want to compute the integral of as an <tt>R</tt> function <tt>f</tt>. In our example, <tt>f</tt> is the standard normal density function and hence takes a single argument <tt>x</tt>. Following the definition of <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span> we define <tt>f</tt> as</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define the standard normal PDF as an R function
f &lt;- function(x) {
  1/(sqrt(2 * pi)) * exp(-0.5 * x^2)
}</code></pre>
<p>Let us check if this function computes standard normal densities by passing a vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define a vector of reals
quants &lt;- c(-1.96, 0, 1.96)
# compute densities
f(quants)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.05844094 0.39894228 0.05844094</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># compare to the results produced by &#39;dnorm()&#39;
f(quants) == dnorm(quants)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<p>The results produced by <tt>f()</tt> are indeed equivalent to those given by <tt>dnorm()</tt>.</p>
<p>Next, we call <tt>integrate()</tt> on <tt>f()</tt> and specify the arguments <tt>lower</tt> and <tt>upper</tt>, the lower and upper limits of integration.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># integrate f()
integrate(f, 
          lower = -Inf, 
          upper = 1.337)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 0.9093887 with absolute error &lt; 1.7e-07</code></pre>
<p>We find that the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(Z \leq 1.337\)</span> is about <span class="math inline">\(90.94\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>A second and much more convenient way is to use the function <tt>pnorm()</tt>, the standard normal cumulative distribution function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute the probability using pnorm()
pnorm(1.337)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9093887</code></pre>
<p>The result matches the outcome of the approach using <tt>integrate()</tt>.</p>
<p>Let us discuss some further examples:</p>
<p>A commonly known result is that <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> probability mass of a standard normal lies in the interval <span class="math inline">\([-1.96, 1.96]\)</span>, that is, in a distance of about <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> standard deviations to the mean. We can easily confirm this by calculating <span class="math display">\[ P(-1.96 \leq Z \leq 1.96) = 1-2\times P(Z \leq -1.96) \]</span> due to symmetry of the standard normal PDF. Thanks to <tt>R</tt>, we can abandon the table of the standard normal CDF found in many other textbooks and instead solve this fast by using <tt>pnorm()</tt>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute the probability
1 - 2 * (pnorm(-1.96)) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9500042</code></pre>
<p>To make statements about the probability of observing outcomes of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in some specific range it is more convenient when we standardize first as shown in Key Concept 4.</p>

<p>Now consider a random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim \mathcal{N}(5, 25)\)</span>. <tt>R</tt> functions that handle the normal distribution can perform the standardization. If we are interested in <span class="math inline">\(P(3 \leq Y \leq 4)\)</span> we can use <tt>pnorm()</tt> and adjust for a mean and/or a standard deviation that deviate from <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1\)</span> by specifying the arguments <tt>mean</tt> and <tt>sd</tt> accordingly. <strong>Attention</strong>: the argument <tt>sd</tt> requires the standard deviation, not the variance!</p>

<p>An extension of the normal distribution in a univariate setting is the multivariate normal distribution. The joint PDF of two random normal variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\begin{split}
g_{X,Y}(x,y) =&amp; \, \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_X\sigma_Y\sqrt{1-\rho_{XY}^2}} \\

\end{split} (\#eq:bivnorm)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:bivnorm) contains the bivariate normal PDF. It is somewhat hard to gain insights from this complicated expression. Instead, let us consider the special case where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are uncorrelated standard normal random variables with densities <span class="math inline">\(f_X(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_Y(y)\)</span> with joint normal distribution.

The joint density of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> then becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ g_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot \exp \left\{ -\frac{1}{2} \left[x^2 + y^2 \right]  \right\}, \tag{2.2}  \]</span></p>

<p>By moving the cursor over the plot you can see that the density is rotationally invariant, i.e., the density at <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> solely depends on the distance of <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> to the origin: geometrically, regions of equal density are edges of concentric circles in the <span class="math inline">\(XY\)</span>-plane, centered at <span class="math inline">\((\mu_X = 0, \mu_Y = 0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The normal distribution has some remarkable characteristics. For example, for two jointly normally distribued variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the conditional expectation function is linear: one can show that <span class="math display">\[ E(Y\vert X) = E(Y) + \rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X} (X - E(X)). \]</span> The application below shows standard bivariate normally distributed sample data along with the conditional expectation function <span class="math inline">\(E(Y\vert X)\)</span> and the marginal densities of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. All elements adjust accordingly as you vary the parameters.</p>

<h3>The Chi-Squared Distribution</h3>
<p>The chi-squared distribution is another distribution relevant in biology. It is often needed when testing special types of hypotheses frequently encountered when dealing with regression models.</p>
<p>The sum of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> squared independent standard normal distributed random variables follows a chi-squared distribution with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> degrees of freedom:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Z_1^2 + \dots + Z_M^2 = \sum_{m=1}^M Z_m^2 \sim \chi^2_M \ \ \text{with} \ \ Z_m \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1) (\#eq:chisq)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>A <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distributed random variable with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> degrees of freedom has expectation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, mode at <span class="math inline">\(M-2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(M \geq 2\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot M\)</span>. For example, for</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Z_1,Z_2,Z_3 \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1) \]</span></p>
<p>it holds that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Z_1^2+Z_2^2+Z_3^3 \sim \chi^2_3. \tag{2.3} \]</span> Using the code below, we can display the PDF and the CDF of a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_3\)</span> random variable in a single plot. This is achieved by setting the argument <tt>add = TRUE</tt> in the second call of <tt>curve()</tt>. Further we adjust limits of both axes using <tt>xlim</tt> and <tt>ylim</tt> and choose different colors to make both functions better distinguishable. The plot is completed by adding a legend with help of <tt>legend()</tt>.</p>

<p>Since the outcomes of a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_M\)</span> distributed random variable are always positive, the support of the related PDF and CDF is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As expectation and variance depend (solely!) on the degrees of freedom, the distribution’s shape changes drastically if we vary the number of squared standard normals that are summed up. This relation is often depicted by overlaying densities for different <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution">Wikipedia Article</a>.</p>
<p>We reproduce this here by plotting the density of the <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1^2\)</span> distribution on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,15]\)</span> with <tt>curve()</tt>. In the next step, we loop over degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(M=2,...,7\)</span> and add a density curve for each <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to the plot. We also adjust the line color for each iteration of the loop by setting <tt>col = M</tt>. At last, we add a legend that displays degrees of freedom and the associated colors.</p>

<h3>The Student t Distribution</h3>
<p><a name="tdist"></a></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> be a standard normal variate, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_M\)</span> random variable and further assume that <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are independent. Then it holds that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{Z}{\sqrt{W/M}} =:X \sim t_M \]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> follows a <em>Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution</em> (or simply <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution) with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Similar to the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_M\)</span> distribution, the shape of a <span class="math inline">\(t_M\)</span> distribution depends on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distributions are symmetric, bell-shaped and look similar to a normal distribution, especially when <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is large. This is not a coincidence: for a sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(t_M\)</span> distribution can be approximated by the standard normal distribution. This approximation works reasonably well for <span class="math inline">\(M\geq 30\)</span>. As we will illustrate later by means of a small simulation study, the <span class="math inline">\(t_{\infty}\)</span> distribution <em>is</em> the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>A <span class="math inline">\(t_M\)</span> distributed random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has an expectation if <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;1\)</span> and it has a variance if <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;2\)</span>.</p>

<p>The plot illustrates what has been said in the previous paragraph: as the degrees of freedom increase, the shape of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution comes closer to that of a standard normal bell curve. Already for <span class="math inline">\(M=25\)</span> we find little difference to the standard normal density. If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is small, we find the distribution to have heavier tails than a standard normal, i.e., it has a “fatter” bell shape.</p>

<h3>The F Distribution</h3>
<p>Another ratio of random variables important to biology is the ratio of two independent <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distributed random variables that are divided by their degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Random Sampling and the Distribution of Sample Averages</h2>
<p>To clarify the basic idea of random sampling, let us jump back to the dice rolling example:</p>
<p>Suppose we are rolling the dice <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. This means we are interested in the outcomes of random <span class="math inline">\(Y_i, \ i=1,...,n\)</span> which are characterized by the same distribution. Since these outcomes are selected randomly, they are <em>random variables</em> themselves and their realizations will differ each time we draw a sample, i.e., each time we roll the dice <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. Furthermore, each observation is randomly drawn from the same population, that is, the numbers from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, and their individual distribution is the same. Hence <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)</span> are identically distributed.</p>
<p>Moreover, we know that the value of any of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> does not provide any information on the remainder of the outcomes In our example, rolling a six as the first observation in our sample does not alter the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(Y_2,\dots,Y_n\)</span>: all numbers are equally likely to occur. This means that all <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> are also independently distributed. Thus <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)</span> are independently and identically distributed (<em>i.i.d.</em>).</p>
<p>The dice example uses this most simple sampling scheme. That is why it is called <em>simple random sampling</em>. This concept is summarized in Key Concept 5.</p>
<div id="KC5" class="keyconcept">
<h3 class="right">
Key Concept 5

<h3 class="left">
Simple Random Sampling and i.i.d. Random Variables
</h3>
<p>
In simple random sampling, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects are drawn at random from a population. Each object is equally likely to end up in the sample. We denote the value of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> randomly drawn object as <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. Since all objects are equally likely to be drawn and the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the same for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i, \dots, Y_n\)</span> are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This means the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the same for all <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\dots,n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> is distributed independently of <span class="math inline">\(Y_2, \dots, Y_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span> is distributed independently of <span class="math inline">\(Y_1, Y_3, \dots, Y_n\)</span> and so forth.
</p>
</div>
<p>What happens if we consider functions of the sample data? Consider the example of rolling a dice two times in a row once again. A sample now consists of two independent random draws from the set <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span>. It is apparent that any function of these two random variables, e.g. their sum, is also random. Convince yourself by executing the code below several times.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(sample(1:6, 2, replace = T))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, this sum, let us call it <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, is a random variable as it depends on randomly drawn summands. For this example, we can completely enumerate all outcomes and hence write down the theoretical probability distribution of our function of the sample data, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<p>We face <span class="math inline">\(6^2=36\)</span> possible pairs. Those pairs are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  &amp;(1,1)    (1,2)   (1,3)   (1,4)   (1,5)   (1,6) \\ 
  &amp;(2,1)    (2,2)   (2,3)   (2,4)   (2,5)   (2,6) \\ 
  &amp;(3,1)    (3,2)   (3,3)   (3,4)   (3,5)   (3,6) \\ 
  &amp;(4,1)    (4,2)   (4,3)   (4,4)   (4,5)   (4,6) \\

  &amp;(6,1)    (6,2)   (6,3)   (6,4)   (6,5)   (6,6)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, possible outcomes for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \left\{ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \right\} . \]</span> Enumeration of outcomes yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  P(S) = 
  \begin{cases} 
    1/36, \ &amp; S = 2 \\ 
    2/36, \ &amp; S = 3 \\
    3/36, \ &amp; S = 4 \\
    4/36, \ &amp; S = 5 \\

    6/36, \ &amp; S = 7 \\
    5/36, \ &amp; S = 8 \\
    4/36, \ &amp; S = 9 \\
    3/36, \ &amp; S = 10 \\
    2/36, \ &amp; S = 11 \\
    1/36, \ &amp; S = 12
  \end{cases}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>We can also compute <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(S)\)</span> as stated in Key Concept 1 and Key Concept 2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Vector of outcomes

<p>Many biological analyses deal with averages of sampled data. It is typically assumed that observations are drawn randomly from a larger, unknown population. As demonstrated for the sample function <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, computing an average of a random sample has the effect that the average is a random variable itself. This random variable in turn has a probability distribution, called the sampling distribution. Knowledge about the sampling distribution of the average is therefore crucial for understanding the performance of our biological estimates.</p>
<p>The <em>sample average</em> of a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations <span class="math inline">\(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = \frac{1}{n} (Y_1 + Y_2 + \cdots + Y_n). \]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is also called the sample mean.</p>
<div id="mean-and-variance-of-the-sample-mean" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Mean and Variance of the Sample Mean</h3>
<p>suppose that all observations <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)</span> are i.i.d. and denote <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y^2\)</span> the mean and the variance of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. Then we have that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E(\overline{Y}) = E\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \right) = \frac{1}{n} E\left(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\right) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E\left(Y_i\right) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \cdot \mu_Y = \mu_Y    \]</span> and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

  =&amp; \frac{\sigma^2_Y}{n} \\

<p>The second summand vanishes since <span class="math inline">\(\text{cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i\neq j\)</span> due to independence. Consequently, the standard deviation of the sample mean is given by <span class="math display">\[\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sqrt{n}}.\]</span></p>
<p>It is worthwhile to mention that these results hold irrespective of the underlying distribution of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[ \overline{Y} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.1).\]</span></p>
<p>We can use <tt>R</tt>’s random number generation facilities to verify this result. The basic idea is to simulate outcomes of the true distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> by repeatedly drawing random samples of 10 observation from the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span> distribution and computing their respective averages. If we do this for a large number of repetitions, the simulated data set of averages should quite accurately reflect the theoretical distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> if the theoretical result holds.</p>
<p>The approach sketched above is an example of what is commonly known as <em>Monte Carlo Simulation</em> or <em>Monte Carlo Experiment</em>. To perform this simulation in <tt>R</tt>, we proceed as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a sample size <tt>n</tt> and the number of samples to be drawn, <tt>reps</tt>.</li>
<li>Use the function <tt>replicate()</tt> in conjunction with <tt>rnorm()</tt> to draw <tt>n</tt> observations from the standard normal distribution <tt>rep</tt> times. <strong>Note</strong>: the outcome of <tt>replicate()</tt> is a matrix with dimensions <tt>n</tt> <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> <tt>rep</tt>. It contains the drawn samples as <em>columns</em>.</li>
<li>Compute sample means using <tt>colMeans()</tt>. This function computes the mean of each column, i.e., of each sample and returns a vector.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># set sample size and number of samples
n &lt;- 10
reps &lt;- 10000
# perform random sampling
samples &lt;- replicate(reps, rnorm(n)) # 10 x 10000 sample matrix
# compute sample means
sample.avgs &lt;- colMeans(samples)</code></pre>
<p>We then end up with a vector of sample averages. You can check the vector property of <tt>sample.avgs</tt>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check that &#39;sample.avgs&#39; is a vector
is.vector(sample.avgs) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># print the first few entries to the console
head(sample.avgs)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -0.1045919  0.2264301  0.5308715 -0.2243476  0.2186909  0.2564663</code></pre>
<p>A straightforward approach to examine the distribution of univariate numerical data is to plot it as a histogram and compare it to some known or assumed distribution. By default, <tt>hist()</tt> will give us a frequency histogram, i.e., a bar chart where observations are grouped into ranges, also called bins. The ordinate reports the number of observations falling into each of the bins. Instead, we want it to report density estimates for comparison purposes. This is achieved by setting the argument <tt>freq = FALSE</tt>. The number of bins is adjusted by the argument <tt>breaks</tt>.</p>
<p>Using <tt>curve()</tt>, we overlay the histogram with a red line, the theoretical density of a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)\)</span> random variable. Remember to use the argument <tt>add = TRUE</tt> to add the curve to the current plot. Otherwise <tt>R</tt> will open a new graphic device and discard the previous plot!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div class="unfolded">

</div>
<p>The sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is indeed very close to that of a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)\)</span> distribution so the Monte Carlo Simulation supports the theoretical claim.</p>
<p>Let us discuss another example where using simple random sampling in a simulation setup helps to verify a well known result. As discussed before, the <a href="#chisquare">Chi-squared</a> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> degrees of freedom arises as the distribution of the sum of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> independent squared standard normal distributed random variables.</p>
<p>To visualize the claim stated in equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-2.3">2.3</a>), we proceed similarly as in the example before:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose the degrees of freedom, <tt>DF</tt>, and the number of samples to be drawn <tt>reps</tt>.</li>
<li>Draw <tt>reps</tt> random samples of size <tt>DF</tt> from the standard normal distribution using <tt>replicate()</tt>.</li>
<li>For each sample, square the outcomes and sum them up column-wise. Store the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, we produce a density estimate for the distribution underlying our simulated data using a density histogram and overlay it with a line graph of the theoretical density function of the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_3\)</span> distribution.</p>

<h3>Large Sample Approximations to Sampling Distributions</h3>
<p>Sampling distributions as considered in the last section play an important role in the development of statistical methods. There are two main approaches in characterizing sampling distributions: an “exact” approach and an “approximate” approach.</p>
<p>The exact approach aims to find a general formula for the sampling distribution that holds for any sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We call this the <em>exact distribution</em> or <em>finite-sample distribution</em>. In the previous examples of dice rolling and normal variates, we have dealt with functions of random variables whose sample distributions are <em>excactly known</em> in the sense that we can write them down as analytic expressions. However, this is not always possible. For <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span>, result (<a href="#mjx-eqn-2.4">2.4</a>) tells us that normality of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> implies normality of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> (we demonstrated this for the special case of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> using a simulation study that involves simple random sampling). Unfortunately, the <em>exact</em> distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is generally unknown and often hard to derive (or even untraceable) if we drop the assumption that the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> have a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Therefore, as can be guessed from its name, the “approximate” approach aims to find an approximation to the sampling distribution where it is required that the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large. A distribution that is used as a large-sample approximation to the sampling distribution is also called the <em>asymptotic distribution</em>. This is due to the fact that the asymptotic distribution <em>is</em> the sampling distribution for <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, i.e., the approximation becomes exact if the sample size goes to infinity. However, the difference between the sampling distribution and the asymptotic distribution is negligible for moderate or even small samples sizes so that approximations using the asymptotic distribution are useful.</p>
<p>In this section we will discuss two well known results that are used to approximate sampling distributions and thus constitute key tools in econometric theory: the <em>law of large numbers</em> and the <em>central limit theorem</em>. The law of large numbers states that in large samples, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is close to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> with high probability. The central limit theorem says that the sampling distribution of the standardized sample average, that is, <span class="math inline">\((\overline{Y} - \mu_Y)/\sigma_{\overline{Y}}\)</span> is asymptotically normally distributed. It is particularly interesting that both results do not depend on the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In other words, being unable to describe the complicated sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not normal, approximations of the latter using the central limit theorem simplify the development and applicability of econometric procedures enormously. This is a key component underlying the theory of statistical inference for regression models. Both results are summarized in Key Concept 6 and Key Concept 7.</p>

Convergence in Probability, Consistency and the Law of Large Numbers
</h3>
<p>
<p>The sample average <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> converges in probability to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is <em>consistent</em> for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> if the probability that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is in the range <span class="math inline">\((\mu_Y - \epsilon)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((\mu_Y + \epsilon)\)</span> becomes arbitrary close to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases for any constant <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>. We write this as <span class="math display">\[ P(\mu_Y-\epsilon \leq \overline{Y} \leq \mu_Y + \epsilon) \rightarrow 1, \, \epsilon &gt; 0 \text{ as } n\rightarrow\infty. \]</span> Consider the independently and identically distributed random variables <span class="math inline">\(Y_i, i=1,\dots,n\)</span> with expectation <span class="math inline">\(E(Y_i)=\mu_Y\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(Y_i)=\sigma^2_Y\)</span>. Under the condition that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_Y&lt; \infty\)</span>, that is, large outliers are unlikely, the law of large numbers thus states that <span class="math display">\[ \overline{Y} \xrightarrow[]{p} \mu_Y. \]</span> The following application simulates a large number of coin tosses (you may set the number of trials using the slider) with a fair coin and computes the fraction of heads observed for each additional toss. The result is a random path that, as stated by the law of large numbers, shows a tendency to approach the value of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> grows.</p>

</div>
<p>The core statement of the law of large numbers is that under quite general conditions, the probability of obtaining a sample average <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> that is close to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> is high if we have a large sample size.</p>
<p>Consider the example of repeatedly tossing a coin where <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the result of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> coin toss. <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is a Bernoulli distributed random variable with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the probability of observing head <span class="math display">\[ P(Y_i) = \begin{cases} p, &amp; Y_i = 1 \\ 1-p, &amp; Y_i = 0 \end{cases} \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.5\)</span> as we assume a fair coin. It is straightforward to show that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mu_Y = p = 0.5. \]</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> denote the proportion of heads in the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> tosses,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ R_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i. \tag{2.5}\]</span></p>
<p>According to the law of large numbers, the observed proportion of heads converges in probability to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y = 0.5\)</span>, the probability of tossing head in a <em>single</em> coin toss, <span class="math display">\[ R_n \xrightarrow[]{p} \mu_Y=0.5 \ \ \text{as} \ \ n \rightarrow \infty.\]</span> This result is the as the one illustrated by the interactive application in Key Concept 6. We now show how to replicate this using <tt>R</tt>.</p>
<p>The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sample <tt>N</tt> observations from the Bernoulli distribution, e.g., using <tt>sample()</tt>.</li>
<li>Calculate the proportion of heads <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> as in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-2.5">2.5</a>). A way to achieve this is to call <tt>cumsum()</tt> on the vector of observations <tt>Y</tt> to obtain its cumulative sum and then divide by the respective number of observations.</li>

<p>There are several things to be said about this plot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The blue graph shows the observed proportion of heads when tossing a coin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> are random variables, <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> is a random variate, too. The path depicted is only one of many possible realizations of <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> as it is determined by the <span class="math inline">\(30000\)</span> observations sampled from the Bernoulli distribution. Thus, the code chunk above produces a different path every time you execute it (try this yourself!).</p></li>
<li><p>If the number of coin tosses <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is small, the proportion of heads may be anything but close to its theoretical value, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y = 0.5\)</span>. However, as more and more observation are included in the sample we find that the path stabilizes in the neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>. The average of multiple trials shows a clear tendency to converge to its expected value as the sample size increases, just as claimed by the law of large numbers.</p></li>

The Central Limit Theorem
</h3>
<p>
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)</span> are independently and identically distributed random variables with expectation <span class="math inline">\(E(Y_i)=\mu_Y\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(Y_i)=\sigma^2_Y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\sigma^2_Y&lt;\infty\)</span>.<br> The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that, if the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity, the distribution of the standardized sample average <span class="math display">\[ \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_Y}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}} = \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_Y}{\sigma_Y/\sqrt{n}} \ \]</span> becomes arbitrarily well approximated by the standard normal distribution. The application below demonstrates the CLT for the sample average of normally distributed random variables with mean <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(25^2\)</span>. You may check the following properties: + The distribution of the sample average is normal. + As the sample size increases, the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> tightens around the true mean of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. + The distribution of the standardized sample average is close to the standard normal distribution for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. <iframe height="620" width="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="normaldisthistWLLN.html"></iframe>
</p>
</div>
<p>According to the CLT, the distribution of the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> of the Bernoulli distributed random variables <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i=1,...,n\)</span>, is well approximated by the normal distribution with parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y=p=0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{Y} = p(1-p) = 0.25\)</span> for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Consequently, for the standardized sample mean we conclude that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{\overline{Y} - 0.5}{0.5/\sqrt{n}} \tag{2.6}\]</span> should be well approximated by the standard normal distribution <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span>. We employ another simulation study to demonstrate this graphically. The idea is as follows.</p>
<p>Draw a large number of random samples, <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> say, of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from the Bernoulli distribution and compute the sample averages. Standardize the averages as shown in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-2.6">2.6</a>). Next, visualize the distribution of the generated standardized sample averages by means of a histogram and compare to the standard normal distribution. Repeat this for different sample sizes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to see how increasing the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> impacts the simulated distribution of the averages.</p>
<p>In <tt>R</tt>, realize this as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We start by defining that the next four subsequently generated figures shall be drawn in a <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> array such that they can be easily compared. This is done by calling <code>par(mfrow = c(2, 2))</code> before generating the figures.</p></li>
<li><p>We define the number of repetitions <tt>reps</tt> as <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> and create a vector of sample sizes named <tt>sample.sizes</tt>.

<li><p>Next, we combine two <tt>for()</tt> loops to simulate the data and plot the distributions.

<p>We see that the simulated sampling distribution of the standardized average tends to deviate strongly from the standard normal distribution if the sample size is small, e.g., for <span class="math inline">\(n=5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span>. However as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> grows, the histograms approach the standard normal distribution.
